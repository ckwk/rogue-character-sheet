Mirror Image				
Cost: Very Expensive	Range: Touch	Duration: 1 minute	Casting time: 2 actions	Response: None
Corruption (1d8)	Choose one, or take 1d8 damage instead: You always see double as if drunk, although closer objects are much easier to see;  A second, ghostly version of you becomes transposed a few inches from you such that it mostly overlaps but shows double in some places; When you speak, your voice seems to double itself slightly out of time making it more difficult to understand what you are saying;			
1-4	You gain a Corruption.                        			
5-8	A perfect duplicate of a target that you touch appears next to them giving them a +1 to AC.  The duplicaet mimics their movements perfectly and stays by their side but is incorporeal and thus cannot effect the world around it.  The first attack that either is aimed at the image and hits (it has the same AC as whoever it is mirroring if it is being targetted) or misses whoever it is mirroring by 1 destroys the image.			
9-12	Two perfect duplicate of a target that you touch appears next to them giving them a +2 to AC.  The duplicates mimic their movements perfectly and stay by their side but are incorporeal and thus cannot effect the world around them.  The first attack that either is aimed at an image and hits (it has the same AC as whoever it is mirroring if it is being targetted) or misses whoever it is mirroring by 1 destroys the image.			
13-15	Three perfect duplicate of a target that you touch appears next to them giving them a +3 to AC.  The duplicates mimic their movements perfectly and stay by their side but are incorporeal and thus cannot effect the world around them.  The first attack that either is aimed at an image and hits (it has the same AC as whoever it is mirroring if it is being targetted) or misses whoever it is mirroring by 1 destroys the image.			
16-18	A perfect duplicate of a target that you touch appears next to them and the target disappears giving them a +2 to AC.  While the image is active, the target remains invisible and receives a +1 on all saves and rolls to hit.  All attacks against the target that hit do damage to the image instead and it will fade after taking half the target's Hit Points in damage or more.			
19-21	Two perfect duplicates of a target that you touch appear next to them and the target disappears giving them a +3 to AC.  While at least one image is active, the target remains invisible and receives a +1 on all saves and rolls to hit.  All attacks against the target that hit do damage to an image instead and it will fade after taking half the target's Hit Points in damage or more.			
22+	Three perfect duplicates of a target that you touch appear next to them and the target disappears giving them a +4 to AC.  While at least one image is active, the target remains invisible and receives a +1 on all saves and rolls to hit.  All attacks against the target that hit do damage to an image instead and it will fade after taking half the target's Hit Points in damage or more.
