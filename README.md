### <u>Dice Roller</u>

Roll dice using the button in the middle of the nav bar.  You can also short-press on an ability score to automatically populate the dice roller with the dice for it's value, for instance tapping on an ability with a score of 5 would auto-populate the dice roller with 1d10 regardless of what it had before.

You can also increase or decrease a value of the a die by tapping the "+" or "-" buttons in the dice roller to easily give bonuses or hindrances.

The dice roller will handle exploding dice for you and has a wide array of optional parameters for certain traits or other instances where you might want to explode on different values or more frequently than the default rules allow.
